It consists of two generic populations of excitatory (E) and inhibitory (I) neurons. Based on biological observations, there is a classical ratio of 4 excitatory neurons for 1 inhibitory neuron and a sparse, random reciprocal connectivity. The network generates a balanced regime where the average depolarization of the neurons is roughly constant, subthreshold, and an asynchronous irregular spiking is the result of fluctuations. Depending on certain key parameters, mainly the amount of external noise injected and the balance between E-I weights, several regimes of activity can be observed. Those regime have been described and classified in [Brunel, 2000], and can be asynchronous/synchronous (from a population viewpoint) or regular/irregular (from a neuron viewpoint).\n","\n","In this implementation, we will take some input from outside of the network, representing the surrounding neurons, in the form of strongly-active Poisson spike sources. These will then feed into excitatory and inhibitory populations of LIF neurons, having a 4:1 ratio and set up in a balanced random fashion. We will use distributions of weights and delays as would occur in the brain.\n","\n","**Run the following cell before you start!**\n"]},{"cell_type":"code","metadata":{"id":"ok09fb0-aRv5"},"source":["# RUN THIS CELL\n","!pip install brian2\n","from brian2 import *"],"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"r_Yl6-MmXJYT"},"source":["Create a variable containing the number of neurons to be simulated in the network and set this to 100.
