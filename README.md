# NC-ICS
Exercises for the class Neuromorphic Computing and Integrative Cognitive Systems, DIBRIS, University of Genoa.

To play with these notebooks on Colab go to http://colab.research.google.com/github and type "SimoNeT-Git", navigate to the "NC-ICT" repository and choose the notebook you want to open.

Take a look at "Start.ipynb" and "GaborFiltering.ipynb" at first. The following exercises are intended as hands-on tutorials for working with the neural simulator Brian2, a useful tool for computational neuroscientists, and starting to deal event-based outputs of a neuromorphic vision sensor.
