# NC-ICS
Exercises for the class Neuromorphic Computing and Integrative Cognitive Systems, DIBRIS, University of Genoa.

To play with these notebooks on Colab go to http://colab.research.google.com/github and type "simo-net", navigate to the "NC-ICS" repository and choose the notebook you want to open.

 - "GaborFiltering.ipynb" is just a basic hands-on explanation on designing and using Gabor filters.
 - "Start.ipynb" is an introduction to the LIF neuron model and the neural simulator Brian2, a useful tool for computational neuroscientists. The following 3 exercises (task1, task2, task3) are intended as hands-on tutorials with growing complexity for working with basic spiking neural networks (SNNs) on Brian2 and starting to deal with event-based outputs of a neuromorphic vision sensor (give a look at task 3 on Reichardt detectors). 
 - "Tutorial_1_.ipynb" and "Tutorial_2_.ipynb" are
