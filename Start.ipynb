The computational units (the nodes) of these networks are inspired by the standard rate-based neural models commonly adopted by the neuroscience community to simulate and study complex network activities. In the steady-state assumption (the internal dynamics of neurons and synapses are not considered) a simple equation describes the relationship between the continuous-valued output $y$ of the neuron and its inputs:\n","\n","$$y = f(\\sum_i w_i \\cdot x_i + b)$$\n","\n","where $x_i$ are the inputs, $w_i$ their weights, $b$ the bias and $f$ is typically a non-linear activation function such as a *sigmoid* or *hyperbolic tangent* function.\n","\n","<center><div>\n","    <img src=\"https://c.mql5.com/2/35/artificialneuron__1.gif\" width = 500/>\n","</div></center>\n","\n","**In ANNs the output is a continuous value depending only on the instantaneous inputs. The neuron does not have an internal state affecting its output and no dynamics is considered.**\n","\n","Despite their use for AI, where inputs and outputs have different interpretations according to the specific applications, from a neuroscience perspective both inputs and outputs are represented by neuronal instantaneous firing rates. As a matter of fact, according to this classical view of neural computation, the atom of information and computation is the amplitude of the **firing rate**, not the individual spikes. In particular, the **precise timing** of spikes has little relevance in this view. In contrast, a number of scientists have argued that neural computation critically relies on the temporal coordination of spikes. This debate originates by the fact that both spike timing and rate information can be drawn from the spike trains outputted by biological neurons: spike timing is what defines pulse trains, whereas rate is an abstract mathematical construction on spike trains."]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"Rd_kESavRRzS"},"source":["## Spiking Models\n","This is where spiking neurons come into play. Spiking neural networks (or SNNs) are considered to be the third generation of neural networks for AI, preceeded by McCulloch-Pitts threshold neurons (\"first generation\") and Artificial Neural Networks with continuous activation functions (\"second generation\"). Among these network models, SNNs are the most biologically realistic ones, as information processing in such computational primitives is directly inspired by biological systems. Here information is encoded in spike trains, i.e. sequences of pulses (discrete, all-or-none events) with precise timing.\n","\n","<center><img src=\"https://miro.medium.com/max/2304/1*MQjX5_S8G2zVEQBd_DrJHg.png\" width=800></center>\n","\n","**SNNs include explicit temporal dynamics, add an additional dependence on the current state (membrane potential) of the neuron, and communicate with each other using spikes.**\n","\n","Biological neurons have been observed to produce sudden and short increases in voltage: spikes. The spike causes a charge to be transferred across the synapse between neurons. The charge from all the presynaptic neurons connected to a postsynaptic neuron builds up, until that neuron releases the charge itself in the form of a spike. The spike travels down the axon of the neuron arriving, after some delay, at the synapses of that neuron, causing charge to be passed forward to the next neuron. And the process repeats. The charge can result in either an excitatory response, in which the membrane voltage of the postsynaptic neuron increases or an inhibitory response, in which the membrane voltage of the postsynaptic neuron decreases as a result of the spike. Therefore SNNs have a dependence on the current state of the neurons, including explicit temporal dynamics describing the evolution of the process."]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"deYbWbRPVhQO"},"source":["# **2.

Here, the state of the neuron at any time, known as the **membrane potential** $u(t)$, depends on its previous state in addition to its current inputs. The dynamics of this state can be described as follows (note that we now have an explicit notion of time):\n","\n","$$\\tau_m \\cdot d{u}/dt = - [u(t) - u_{rest}] + R \\cdot i(t)$$\n","\n","where $\\tau_m$ is the membrane time constant, which determines how much the neuron depends on its previous states and inputs (therefore defines the neuron's memory), $u_{rest}$ is the membrane potential in the resting state and $i(t)$ is an input current.

This is why the neuron model is referred to as a Leaky Integrate and Fire model.

Exercises**\n","The following exercises are designed to provide a hands-on introduction to Brian2 and enhance your understanding of SNNs. You should follow the step-by-step instructions in the linked notebooks.\n","\n"," - [Task 1: Synfire Chain](https://github.com/SimoNeT-Git/NC-ICT-class/blob/main/task1-SynfireChain.ipynb)\n","    - Create a **synfire chain** network from a single \"*NeuronGroup*\" of 100 inter-connected LIF neurons. Use a \"*SpikeGeneratorGroup*\" to stimulate the first neuron in the population at the start, thus triggering the resulting population dynamics. Record spikes and visualise a rasterplot (use \"*scatter*\" function from matplotlib.pyplot) of population activity after running the \"*Network*\" for 2 seconds.\n","    - See the notebook for further extensions.\n"," - [Task 2: Balanced Random Cortex-like Network](https://github.com/SimoNeT-Git/NC-ICT-class/blob/main/task2-BalancedRandomNet.ipynb)\n","    - Create a **balanced random network** consisting of one excitatory (E) and one inhibitory (I) \"*NeuronGroup*\" of LIF neurons, with a 4:1 E-I ratio and sparse reciprocal connectivity. The E population excites I and itself, while I inhibites E and itself. Extract weights and delays from normal distributions and use a different resting potential for each neuron taking it from a uniform distribution. Stimulate each neuron using a one-to-one connection from a \"*PoissonGroup*\" with rate 1000Hz. Run the \"*Network*\" for 1 second and visualise a rasterplot with all spikes from both populations.\n","    - See the notebook for further extensions.\n"," - [Task 3: Reichardt Detectors on Neuromorphic Sensor's Recordings](https://github.com/SimoNeT-Git/NC-ICT-class/blob/main/task3-ReichardtDetectors.ipynb)\n","    - Create a **Hassenstein-Reichardt detector** consisting of subsequent spatial and temporal filtering of the input spikes. Such input consists of event-based data recorded from the neuromorphic sensor. Code for the initial data loading and pre-processing is given and you will have to build the network for motion perception. The network is made of a \"*SpikeGeneratorGroup*\" for the input events and 3 populations of LIF neurons. The first \"*NeuronGroup*\" applies convolution on the input data (spatial filtering) while the other 2 groups set the delays (temporal filtering) in case of both rightward (R) and leftward (L) motion selectivity. Run the \"*Network*\" for 300ms. Visualise membrane potentials and spikes of the convolutional layer, and the resulting outputs of R and L detectors.\n","    - See the notebook for further extensions."]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"7UzsQ_0jh3qZ"},"source":["\n","\n","---\n","\n","\n","# References & End Notes\n","\n","Below I report some links to online material which you could find useful if interested on these topics and want to learn more:\n"," \n"," 1.
